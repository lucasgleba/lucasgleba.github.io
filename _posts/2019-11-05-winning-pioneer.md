During my first weeks at university, one of the most exciting things going on in my life was the [Pioneer Tournament](https://pioneer.app/r/lucasgleba/p1a1u39j). It was great seeing people care about optimizing the use of talent. Especially since they were trying to do so in an efficient, well incentivized, and scalable way. I was very proud to [be among the winners](https://pioneer.app/winners/lucas-gleba).

I suspect that was one of the reasons I spent a significant fraction of the free time I got from skipping class thinking about games and talent. From Pioneer I learned how powerful games can be, especially optimizing the use of talent, and how underutilized they are.
