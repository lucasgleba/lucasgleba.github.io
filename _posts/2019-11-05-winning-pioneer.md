During my first weeks at university, one of the most exciting things going on in my life was the Pioneer Tournament [1]. It was great seeing people care about optimizing the use of talent. Especially since they were trying to do so in an efficient, well incentivized, and scalable way. I was very proud to be among the winners [2].

I suspect that had a significant influence in making me spend a significant fraction of the free time I got from skipping class thinking about games and talent. From Pioneer I learned how powerful games can be, especially optimizing the use of talent, and how underutilized they are.
