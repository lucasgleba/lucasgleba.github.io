#### ðŸ§µTakeaways from a few days in San Francisco meeting founders
- Keep it real.
- It's OK not to know.
- Be willing to be naive.
- Young people can achieve great things.
- Great achievements can come from very unfortunate circumstances.
- There might be a good reason why your idea is not already a reality. There might be none.
- Be quick when making reversible decisions and extra thoughtful when making non-reversible ones.
- Ups and downs come and go very quickly. Keep moving.
- Generalize. Create abstractions.
- Silicon Valley is just a few hundred people.
- Reach out to people. Send lots of cold emails. Explore social graphs. Be willing to play the numbers game if necessary.
- Hire faster*.
- Never fire someone by surpriseâ€”but do it quickly.
- Zoom is still very far from realistically emulating meeting in real life.
- Despite its obvious downsides, SF is an amazing city.
- Ride-sharing apps are extremely convenient.

*Relevant contributions in regards to hiring faster.*
- "I think there was important context here. The company had strong product market fit _in hindsight_ and the founders potentially recognized it a little later. Iâ€™d say in general that hire slowly is still good." Everett Berry [@everettpberry](https://twitter.com/everettpberry/status/1191156143688568833)
- "Dangerous. Overhiring and hiring the wrong people are probably the two most common mistakes in SV. Even the VC firms do it to themselves. No one is immune." David Holz [@DavidSHolz](https://twitter.com/DavidSHolz/status/1191422851003215873)
